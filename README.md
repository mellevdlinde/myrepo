Topic: What does it mean to be a ‘workout’ playlist? Find several examples of workout playlists on Spotify and comparable playlists without the workout label. Is there a measurable difference between the groups?

So far, I compared the "Beast Mode" playlist (by spotify) and "Workout Flow" playlist (by Joe Kay) with the mellow "real good shit" playlist (by Tom Misch).

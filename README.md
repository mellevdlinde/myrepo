Topic: What does it mean to be a ‘workout’ playlist? Find several examples of workout playlists on Spotify and comparable playlists without the workout label. Is there a measurable difference between the groups?

So far, I compared the following workout playlists: Beast Mode, Motivation Mix and Top Hits Workout. The "chill" playlists are: JAEL & CHILL, real good shit and Lo-Fi Beats. 
There was no real difference in danceability, all means were about .65, and the standard deviations about .12. As measured by Spotify, the workout playlists score higher on energy *(M = 0.81, SD = 0.12)* than the chill playlists *(M = 0.45, SD = 0.17)*. This is not very surprising, since a workout playlist should motivate. Therefore a higher energy level might be more motivating!
